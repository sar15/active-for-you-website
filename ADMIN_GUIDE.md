## 👤 How to Use Admin Upload

### For Admins:

1. **Login as Admin**
   - Click the small "Admin" link in the footer (bottom of any page)
   - OR navigate to Gallery page (upload controls only show when logged in)

2. **Enter Password**
   - A login modal will appear
   - Enter your admin password
   - Click "Login"

3. **Navigate to Gallery**
   - Go to the Gallery page
   - You'll now see the admin controls (Upload Photos and Logout buttons)

4. **Upload Photos**
   - Click "Upload Photos" button
   - Select one or multiple images
   - Images will be uploaded and saved permanently

5. **Delete Photos**
   - Hover over any image in the gallery
   - Click the red trash icon to delete
   - Confirm deletion

6. **Logout**
   - Click the "Logout" button when done
   - This hides admin controls and prevents unauthorized changes

### For Regular Visitors:

- ✅ They can view all gallery images normally
- ❌ They see NO upload buttons or admin controls

## 🔒 Security Features

✅ **Visual Feedback** - Clear indicators when admin mode is active

✅ **Easy Logout** - One-click logout to secure the session

## ⚠️ Important Security Notes

### 1. Change the Default Password

The default password `admin123` is **NOT SECURE**. Change it immediately!

**Recommended Password Guidelines:**
- At least 12 characters long
- Mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
- Include numbers and special characters
- Example: `MyTrust2024@Secure!`

### 2. Don't Share the Password

- Only share with trusted team members
- Consider using different passwords for different admins (requires code modification)
- Change the password regularly

### 3. Limitations

This is a **client-side authentication** system, which means:
- ⚠️ The password is stored in the HTML file (visible in source code)
- ⚠️ This is suitable for basic protection, not high-security needs
- ✅ Good enough to prevent casual users from uploading
- ✅ Uploaded images are temporary (lost on page refresh)

### 4. For Better Security

If you need stronger security, consider:
- Using a backend server with proper authentication
- Implementing JWT tokens
- Using services like Firebase Authentication
- Adding a database to permanently store images

## 📸 Upload Guidelines for Admins

### Image Requirements:
- **Format:** JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP
- **Max Size:** 5MB per image
- **Recommended Size:** 1920x1080px or similar
- **Aspect Ratio:** Any (will be cropped to fit)

### Best Practices:
1. **Compress images** before uploading (use tinypng.com)
2. **Use descriptive filenames** (becomes the category label)
3. **Upload high-quality photos** that represent your work
4. **Test on mobile** after uploading

### What Happens to Uploaded Images:
- ✅ Images are stored **permanently** in browser localStorage
- ✅ They will **persist** even after page refresh
- ✅ They stay on the same browser/device
- ⚠️ They are **NOT synced** across different browsers or devices
- ⚠️ Clearing browser data will delete them

### Storage Details:
- **Location:** Browser localStorage (5-10MB limit)
- **Persistence:** Permanent until browser data is cleared
- **Scope:** Per browser/device only
- **Backup:** Not automatically backed up

### To Sync Across Devices:
You need to add a backend service. Options:
- **Firebase Storage** (recommended for beginners)
- **Cloudinary** (image hosting service)
- **AWS S3** (for advanced users)
- **Custom backend** (Node.js, PHP, etc.)

## 🎯 Admin Workflow

### Daily Use:
1. Open website
2. Click "Admin" link in footer

5. Upload or delete photos as needed
6. Logout when done

### After Page Refresh:
- Admin session is cleared (need to login again)
- ✅ Uploaded images remain saved (localStorage)
- ✅ All changes are permanent

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: "Incorrect password!" message

**Solution:**
- Check that you're using the correct password
- Password is case-sensitive

**Solution:**
- Make sure you're logged in as admin
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Try refreshing the page and logging in again

### Problem: Images disappear after clearing browser data

## 🔄 Multiple Admin Accounts (Advanced)

If you want different passwords for different admins, modify the code:

```javascript
// Replace the handleAdminLogin function with:
const handleAdminLogin = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    // Multiple admin passwords
    const ADMIN_PASSWORDS = [
        'admin1password',
        'admin2password',
        'admin3password'
    ];
    
    if (ADMIN_PASSWORDS.includes(adminPassword)) {
        setIsAdminAuthenticated(true);
        setShowAdminLogin(false);
        setAdminPassword('');
        setNotification({ show: true, message: 'Admin access granted!' });
        setTimeout(() => setNotification({ show: false, message: '' }), 3000);
    } else {
        setNotification({ show: true, message: 'Incorrect password!' });
        setTimeout(() => setNotification({ show: false, message: '' }), 3000);
        setAdminPassword('');
    }
};
```
