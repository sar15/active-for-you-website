## 🎯 How It Works

### For Regular Visitors:
- ✅ Can view all gallery images
- ❌ Cannot upload images
- ✅ See "Admin Upload" button (but can't use it)

### For Admins:
- ✅ Click "Admin Upload" button
- ✅ Enter password
- ✅ Upload multiple images
- ✅ Logout when done

---

## 🔐 Security Features

✅ Password-protected uploads  
✅ Only admins can add photos  
✅ File type validation (images only)  
✅ File size limit (5MB max)  
✅ Session-based authentication  
✅ Easy logout button  

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Uploaded Images Are Temporary
- Images disappear on page refresh
- This is by design (no backend)
- To make permanent, add backend storage

### Password Security
- Default password: `admin123`
- **MUST CHANGE** before deploying
- Password is in the HTML file (visible in source)
- Good for basic protection, not high-security

### Recommended For:
- ✅ Small organizations
- ✅ Trusted admin team
- ✅ Basic upload control
- ❌ NOT for sensitive data
- ❌ NOT for public upload systems
